# Uber-Home
Have you ever wondered what the cheapest way for you to get home would be? Probably. 

When I first started working in the South Bay, I had no access to a car; however, I didhave a lot of spare time and a vested interest in taking an Uber back home, when I would be out in the city. 
Funny enough, whenever you needed an Über or even a POOL, prices would be exorbitant and you would have to take the CalTrain home (thats almost 2hrs to my place). Further, you probably had to Uber to the CalTrain Station and then from the station to home anyway.

That really sucks. 

But something interesting that I would come across on my long and arduous journey home was that Uber prices fluctuated haphazardly even between short distances. For instance, if I were to take an Über from the Union Square in San Francisco, I would have to pay about $102.00 at peek weekend times; however, step away a few blocks to A.C.T's geary street Theatre and the cost would fall to $34.50. Amazing right!

To exploit Über's surge pricing and because I love walking around the city, I created Uber-home, a twilio-text messaging service that tells you the cheapest spot to call an Über POOL back home after a long day of fun and frolick.
